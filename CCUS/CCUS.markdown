# CCUS language definition

## Version 1.0.0.0 (2021-2022)

The language is designed to be able to program anything desiert with low effort in mind.

The language is heavily inspired by the programming languages: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [C/C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/) from their syntax and structures.

Example Code for a function `f(x) = 2x`:

```
func f(num x)
{
  ret 2 * x;
}
```
